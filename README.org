Small utility program for dealing with lists in an =org-mode= drawer.

More information will be available soonâ„¢, once the initial development is over.

** Testing

Ideally, you should use [[http://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Cask]] for running tests. So first you need to install
=cask=. If you are using [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]], then you need to ignore dependencies during
=cask= installation.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ brew install cask --ignore-dependencies
#+END_SRC

One you have =cask=, you need to install all dependencies.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ cask install
#+END_SRC

Now you can run tests.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ cask exec ert-runner
#+END_SRC
